            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,
                    <q class="allneighbors">
                        “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”
                    </q>
                    The farmer said,
                    <q class="farmer">

                        <em>Maybe</em>
                        .
                    </q>
                    The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,
                    <q>
                        “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”
                    </q>
                    The farmer again said,
                    <q>

                        <em>Maybe</em>
                        .
                    </q>
                    The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,
                    <q>
                        Oh dear, that’s too
                            <a class="bad" target="_blank" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/bad" title="What is bad?">bad</a>
                        ,
                    </q>
                    and the farmer responded,
                    <q>

                        <em>Maybe</em>
                        .
                    </q>
                    The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,
                    <q>
                        Isn’t that great!
                    </q>
                    Again, he said,
                    <q>

                        <em>Maybe</em>
                        .
                    </q>
                    The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is
                    <q>

                    </q>
                    or
                    <q>
                        <a class="bad" target="_blank" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/bad" title="What is bad?">bad</a>
                    </q>
                    — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of
                    <q>
                        <a class="good" target="_blank" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/good" title="What is good?">good</a>
                    </q>
                    fortune.
